# Ai-Predicator
Fake AI Predictor is a fun and creative web-based project that pretends to use Artificial Intelligence to predict outcomes. In reality, it uses simple JavaScript logic like random values and conditional statements to generate results. The goal of this project is not accuracy, but entertainment and learning.
